> Please do your best to postmark your gifts, pull your hijinks, or do whatever else you need to by 1/13/24! (Extending this deadline by a week bc the Automatic Satan Assigner was late.)
> 
> If you're buying a gift please try to stick to like under $50 or whatever.

> Send your gift from "satan" ðŸ˜ˆ

> All Secret Satans will be revealed in 2024... since we're doing it remotely we'll either do a zoom or have a thread where everyone can share what gift they got, and then guess who their Satan was!
